# ShadowTravelor

ShadowTravelor is an Android-App to reduce stress in rush hour as well as help prevent 
accidents on the streets.  

Your smartphone may be a super assistant to help find the way or catch the bus at the right. time. 
BUT, it can also be a huge risk as it is easily disurbing, not only for yourself but for everyone 
else if you just listen loud enough music. Its huge impact has to get under control!

We have set our goals in symbiosis with the Workshops by Zurich and the Swiss Transport Associations. 
We have found a solution following these criterias:

- autonomous
	-- Detects when you leave
	-- Detects what type of transport you are using
	-- Detects where you go
- Objective Assessment
	-- Music is distraction
	-- loud music is annoying
	-- Usage of phone while walking is not only for you dangerous
	-- Usage of public transport while rush hour is often unnecessary and also a risk
	
Our app **ShadowTravelor** uses gameification to motivate users to improve safety in traffic. 
The app tracks the user as soon as he leaves his home and only stops when he reaches his destiny. 
For every minute he spends walking without using his smartphone, he gets points. 
For every minute he bypasses rush hour, he gets points. 
The points system is really mature, as it is even dependent on the volume of music the user is listening to!
